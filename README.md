## Environment Setup üß±

To have your own local instance of this app, you will need 2 API keys, and your deployment URL.

- [`XATA_API_TOKEN`](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/api-keys): to connect your own Xata workspace.
- `VERCEL_URL`: popullated by Vercel, on your local environment it‚Äôs your local server url (`https://localhost:3000` by default).

Once you have those keys, you can create a `.env.local` as shown in `.env.template`.

## Link to Xata ü¶ã

You can run the `xata init` command with some default configuration:

```sh
pnpm xata:link
```

By the end you should have the `XATA_API_TOKEN` in your `.env.local` and a `.xatarc` file created.

## Database Seed üå±

Once you have a working link with the workspace, you can run:

```sh
pnpm xata:seed
```

This task will add **100 rows of mocked data** to get you started with a working app.

## Run Locally üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è

Once you project is linked and database has data, you can start the development server.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

By default, server will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
